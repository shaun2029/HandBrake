# Hack to force hard CBR for streaming
The main HandBreak project does not produce constant bitrate H264 that satisfies my streaming needs.
This fork overrides some parameters to improve CBR performance, only when Hanbrake is set to use CBR.

    param.i_keyint_min *= 3;                          //Keyint to fps x 3
    param.i_keyint_max = param.i_keyint_min;
    param.i_scenecut_threshold = 0;
    param.i_nal_hrd = X264_NAL_HRD_CBR;               // Hard CBR
    param.rc.i_vbv_max_bitrate = job->vbitrate;       // Set to average bitrate
    param.rc.i_vbv_buffer_size = job->vbitrate * 2;   // Set to 2 x bitrate
    param.rc.i_lookahead = param.i_keyint_min;        // Lookahead set to 3 x fps

HandBrake is an open-source video transcoder available for Linux, Mac, and Windows, licensed under the [GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2](LICENSE).

HandBrake takes videos you already have and makes new ones that work on your mobile phone, tablet, TV media player, game console, computer, or web browserâ€”nearly anything that supports modern video formats.

HandBrake works with most common video files and formats, including ones created by consumer and professional video cameras, mobile devices such as phones and tablets, game and computer screen recordings, and DVD and Blu-ray discs. HandBrake leverages tools such as FFmpeg, x264, and x265 to create new MP4 or MKV video files from these *Sources*.
